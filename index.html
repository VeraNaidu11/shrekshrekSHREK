<h2> THREE Reasons why Shrek 2 is a theatrical masterpiece</h2>
<h3>
    1) The amazing cover of Holding out for A Hero.
</h3>
<p> During the epic fight scene in the movie, The Fairy Godmother sings Holding out for A Hero. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLHCS6oL7lo"> You can listen to the song as used in the movie here! </a> This cover is perfect and immaculate and I genuinely thought this was 10 thousand times better than the original. 
</p>
<h3>
    2) The movie actually built onto the story in a good way, unlike other sequels
</h3>
<p>
    Shrek 2 built onto the fact that Fiona was actually royalty and showed that she actually had parents who were royale AND cared about her, plus the antagonists, Fairy Godmother and her son, Prince Charming, actually had a reason to dislike Shrek.
</p>
<h3>
    3) The movie is very good
