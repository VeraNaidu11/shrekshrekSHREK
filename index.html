    Summary of the movie
</h2>
<h4>
    SPOILERS AHEAD! <br> This is also taken straight from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_2"> WIKIPEDIA page! </a>

<p>
Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon to find they have been invited by Fiona's parents to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage. Shrek initially refuses to attend, but Fiona convinces him, and along with Donkey, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see the ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument and Fiona, disgusted at their behavior, locks herself away in her room. Shrek worries that he is losing Fiona, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.
<br>
<br>
Harold is reprimanded by the Fairy Godmother, as her son, Prince Charming, was to marry Fiona in exchange for Harold's own happy ending. She orders him to get rid of Shrek, so Harold arranges for Puss in Boots to assassinate him under the guise of a hunting trip. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to be an ally. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss sneak into the Fairy Godmother's factory and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will make him good enough for Fiona. Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion but nothing happens. Shrek laments before he and Donkey both suddenly fall asleep. Meanwhile, in Far Far Away, Fiona prepares to find Shrek so they can return home, but she too falls asleep.
<br>
<br>
The following morning, the potion's effects are clear: Shrek and Fiona are human, and Donkey is a white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the theft, has sent Charming to pose as Shrek and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, believing that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.
<br>
<br>
Fiona does not reciprocate Charming's advances, so to ensure she falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal knights. While the royal ball begins, the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, and the Three Blind Mice rescue the trio and they storm the castle with the help of the Muffin Man's monster-sized gingerbread man.
<br>
<br>
Shrek fails to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love, Fiona knocks him out; Harold reveals that he didn't give Fiona the love potion. The now-enraged Fairy Godmother tries to kill Shrek with her magic wand, but Harold jumps in front of it; the spell ricochets off his armor and disintegrates her. With the Fairy Godmother gone, Harold reverts back into the Frog Prince. Harold apologizes, admitting to using the "Happily Ever After" potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love, and approves Shrek and Fiona's marriage. Lillian assures Harold that she still loves him.
As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek's offer to remain human, and they revert into ogres, while Donkey also returns to normal.

<h2> THREE Reasons why Shrek 2 is a theatrical masterpiece</h2>
<h3>
    1) The amazing cover of Holding out for A Hero.
</h3>
<p> During the epic fight scene in the movie, The Fairy Godmother sings Holding out for A Hero. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLHCS6oL7lo"> You can listen to the song as used in the movie here! </a> This cover is perfect and immaculate and I genuinely thought this was 10 thousand times better than the original. 
</p>
<h3>
    2) The movie actually built onto the story in a good way, unlike other sequels
</h3>
<p>
    Shrek 2 built onto the fact that Fiona was actually royalty and showed that she actually had parents who were royale AND cared about her, plus the antagonists, Fairy Godmother and her son, Prince Charming, actually had a reason to dislike Shrek.
</p>
<h3>
    3) The movie is very good
